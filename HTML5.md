2. What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization)?

Ans.
    Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web  search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users, and these visitors can be converted into customers. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines.

3. Advantages of semantic elements in HTML?

Ans. Advantages of semantic tags
    * It's easier for computers to understand what content is in your document and how it is structured. For example, having article tags would make it easier for a tool like Safari Reader or Readability to find the content of a blog post.
    * Screen readers will also have more information about what is on the page. This is incredibly useful for vision impaired users, especially since they can more easily jump to navigation controls and article contents while skipping less important content.
    * It's easier for developers to logically sort out parts of HTML documents, and easier to semantically add CSS styles around your HTML.
    * Better for SEO

4. Difference between inline and block level elements?
Ans.
    A block-display element will span the full width of the space available to it, and so will start on a new line in the flow of HTML. The flow will continue on a new line after the block-display element.
    Block level tags: div, h1-h6, p, ul, ol, dl, li, dt, dd, table, blockquote, pre, form

    Inline-display elements don’t break the flow. They just fit in with the flow of the document.
    Inline level tags: span, input, a, strong, em, img, br, abbr, acronym

    * week

6. Differences between SVG and canvas elements.
Ans.

    * SVG Is Vector-based, Canvas Manipulates Pixels

    The differences are a lot less dramatic visually, as you can load bitmaps in SVG, and you can draw lines using the canvas API. However, creating the image may be easier using one technology over the other, depending on whether your graphic is mainly line-based or more image-like.

    * SVG Relies on Files, Canvas Uses Pure Scripting

    SVG images are defined in XML. As a result, every SVG element is appended to the Document Object Model (DOM) and can be manipulated using a combination of JavaScript and CSS. Moreover, you can attach an event handlers to a SVG element or update its properties based on another document event. Canvas, on the other hand, is a simple graphics API. It draws pixels and nothing more. Hence, there's no way to alter existing drawings or react to events. If you want to update the Canvas image, you have to redraw it.


7. Explain DOCTYPE in HTML.
Ans.

    A document type declaration, or DOCTYPE, is an instruction that associates a particular SGML or XML document (for example, a webpage) with a document type definition (DTD) (for example, the formal definition of a particular version of HTML1.0 - HTML 4.0). In the serialized form of the document, it manifests as a short string of markup that conforms to a particular syntax
